GA Projects


Approach taken:

Spent all day one and two planning the project. Also got ideas from the my classmates during the stand ups as we all choose the same project.

Step I - Got an example of what I wanted to build - www.mathsisfun.com/games/connect4.html

Step II - Did a mock-up using wireframe -> http://wireframe.cc/xUPOI6

Step III - Linked the mock-up with user stories to ensure UI usability and logic

Step IV - Got ideas and feedback from colleagues during our stand updates

Step V - Setup a basic layout mock-up in HTML

Step VI - Start my Pseudo-code
